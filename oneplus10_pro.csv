0,No words to say.the first impression itself shows that it is a beastðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. congratulations to  OnePlus for making their first one-time foldable phone.
1,"Only difference is the price. Hassle bad is really bad and big gimmick.I am still amaze how the photo quality of camera are same for nord and op10pro on oneplus site for price 25k and 67k respectively.Message and dialler UI is really funky and cartoonist. The cover they are giving with phone is rough from inside and smooth from outside I still don't understand the reason.The best feature of this phone is voice play back of ""call recording started"" and ""call recording ended"" to both the party loudly."
2,"I've Been using iPhone since iPhone 4 - iPhone 13..Maybe this phone is nice but if you are an iPhone user don't go for OnePlus.You can't compare an iPhone with OnePlus, there's no match.iPhone 11 is way better than this phone.Camera is good but not so satisfying, display is better, charging and battery is good, overall it was not worth for me to shift from an iPhone to OnePlus."
3,I have exchange my mobile but facing same problemVery big problem of draining batteryCharging two times in a day.
4,"The phone got delivered within a day so no complains with that...So I have used this device now for quite some days and what I think is its good but certainly can improve...Lets talk about Pros1. Great display, screen and feel. One of the best gives premium feeling.2. Camera and color balance definitely better than older devices.3. SD 8 gen 1 makes it fast.4. Security like lock screen face detection in display fingerprint is really fast and responsive.5. Boost for gaming and all works really good. Surprisingly during games like Battleground, call of duty phone is cool but during genshin impact too much heating.6. Sound quality is good too7. Oxygen OS with android 12 is smoooooth.Cons:1. Battery drains fast if u use 120 hz and always on display, anyways it gives screen time of 5 hr 15 min thats pretty less just somehow manages for a day.2. Below 10% if u work on camera or video phone gets heated.3. Apps like MX player, Instagram takes lot of battery and heats the phone. So heatong issue is there and hopefully oneplus tries to fix this by update.4. Ringtones and sounds kind a feel very low sometimes previous phone like my 8T had good sound volume.So the phone has only battery issues but not that bad compared to other devices. Still better than others."
5,The phone is getting so heat ðŸ”¥..... & battery also getting low so fast
6,"                                    Â I have been using OnePlus for almost 8 years, since the Flagship started with vision of Never Settle. I used OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, OnePlus Five, OnePlus 6, OnePlus 7T, and now this time it is going to be OnePlus10Pro, the beast in all respects.It reminds me of OnePlusOne, as OnePlusOne was a flagship killer after that OnePlus Five and then OnePlus7T, all these had created impact and this time OnePlus10Pro for sure.Everything used in the OnePlus10Pro is top notch.I'm a die hard fan of OnePlus Phones. The best is launched and I didn't had to look anywhere. I plan for Samsung but OnePlus has its own way of giving an extra ordinary experience."
7,"Please don't buy this phone OnePlus has made one of the worst os.You will get disappointed and will make one of the costliest mistake of your life .Worst os , worst system launcher ,One plus is becoming a hopeless company , older os had the best optimization don't buy this phone go for other options at this price ...ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡"
8,You will never regret for buying this pro.Everything arranged in a package. Thanks to #Oneplusteam.
9,"Couple of issues we faced with this phone -A. It heats up very quicklyB. Network keeps on disconnectingC. Screen flickers while scrolling up and downD. Phone had to be reset because it couldn't recognise the right PIN. Didn't give any response when entering the right pin but gave the response Incorrect pin entered when I entered the wrong pin.I would strongly suggest not to buy this phone. In my case, I asked for a return of this phone but Amazon is sending a technician to visit my place. Let's see if Amazon accept the return request."
10,I have been using OnePlus mobiles from 5t to 10 pro and 10pro was the worest mobile having hanging issues and suddenly blur screen.
11,                                    Â Looks good !!! That's it !!! Don't fall for it !!!it's the second replacement phone; wre am facing different issues... Folks stay away from one plus 10 pro ... It's not a flagship product of OnePlus ... It's a disaster... Such a waste of time & money ...
12,"Phone is good, but it's overpriced.It's worth around 50-55k in INR only.Finger sensor is not working properly..."
13,"Got this product on 6 Apr 2022 and I am using from last 2 days . I must say experience is very smooth and literally it is a pro phone.My last 2 phones is iPhone 12 and Samsung galaxy z flip 3 and I must say, I am not regreting to buy this phone.OS experience - 5 starNo heating issueCamera ðŸ“¸ - 4 starPerformance - 5 starNo laggingIn-hand feeling - premium"
14,The images taken from back main camera in room light when zoom is between 1 to 3 or any closeup shots with back camera will have a stain mark in the images. Even Amazon agreed there is a bug in one plus 10 pro. I have returned it and interested to get a replacement. I lost the trust in OnePlus. Disappointed with new oneplus 10 pro device. I have also posted this bug to OnePlus India. Not a great camera phone. Display and sound is good but with this defect in camera I think it will get a backfire.
15,Good product OnePlus 10 pro or network problem
16,"This one plus 10 pro is superb phone.Performance is very goodHeating issue is less.Battery backup is fineCharging speed is very faster almost 20% faster than 65W chargers.Case provided is perfect.Phone is slim also not too much heavier.Display brightness is cool.Best thing I love is super wide angle camera. 150* is amazing.Overall I'm happy to having this phone.Thank You,"
17,1. Normal usage tem. 39Â° to 46Â° (Game not installed)2. FB Massenger Video calling 43Â° temprature.3.Video Enhancement Engine inactive every time. Bcz of overheating.i bought a mini 4 burner stove mate. I want to replace my phone.
18,Being OnePlus fan ....product is waste..No automatic call recording pre announcement is wasteAmazon has no return policy ..sold phone and shifted to other brand
19,"                                    Â Device charging speed is like never seen before, and heats up a bit but not burning red hot.Warms up a bit on heavy tasks, but completely fine and expected, as you can see a flawless performance on any tasks.Final verdict -If you are looking for an android dual physical sim tray, with flagship performance and awesome built quality and curved flagship display (cameras are not upto iPhone pros but Android level at par not the best)This is where your search ends unless you bump up your budget upto s22 ultra.Also felt it overpriced by 5KBy next 6 months we should see this extra dropped off.But likewise by next year this will drop by 10K :p"
20,Very bad phone while using to much hot both the side front n back
21,HappyðŸ˜€
22,Handset was overheating on first charging
23,Superb nice. Display my god awesome. Camera is ok.Battery is some what disappointed me. SOT is strictly 4.30 hrs to 5 hrs. Other than this every thing good
24,"Phone is over heating,battery draining,voice is not clear"
25,"Though this phone is a bit pricey in exchange mode and by applying bank discount you can get this phone near 55k. But anyways flagships are expected to be priced higher. The phone is ultra smooth, comes on Android 12, and first time OnePlus has given 80watt charger with big 5000mA battery that makes phone work v smooth and last longer. I had charged my phone yesterday and while writing this review with 17 hr phone usage and 2.5 hr screen time, my batter is 31%. Phone looks very premium in hand. For protection it comes with silicon back cover with a good quality screen protector pre-installed. As of now I have not come accross any cons. Will update after regular usage of few days."
26,                                    Â UpdateGot the replacement done yesterday. The new piece also struggles to connect to 5g wifi shows timeout error and gets heated. Fun part my one plus 2 phone connects within fraction of second though it beinga vintage now...Need to monitor it more for few days to see if app crashes or dead screen happens.......Frequent app crashes.. screen goes dark and nothing happens.. all attempts to revive doesnt work. Better to buy some 15k phone rather than this buggy phoneCamera quality is pathetic considering the hefty price..If you have money to waste plz buy this..
27,Got my phone after so many days but unfortunately screen is not responding to any touch. Place a request for replacement. Will write actual review after I get a replacement.Edit: Had to go for refund instead of replacement. Will update review when get a working deviceEdit: Somehow my device started working when the pickup agent came to pick it. Cancelled my return and set it up.
28,my previous phone ONeplus 7 is more better ....Oxygen OS dies...better go for iphone 12 or 13..which is way better ....or else wait NOTHING phone to arrive ...
29,I had a Motorola G 5G and needed a faster phone. Had used a OnePlus 3T in the past and so decided to upgrade to 10 Pro due to a cleaner UI and Android implementation as also an enticing exchange offer. I made a bad decision. The phone is a battery hog despite shutting down all power-hungry apps and processes. Not happy with my purchase.
30,"I am very sad to see oneplus brand  comprising on its strengths.Oneplus was known to be the best Android phones that could give very tough competition to Iphones.But it doesn't look like that anymore.I have been using oneplus 5t, since then I didn't upgrade, as there was no need.My oneplus 5t is still a rocket, superfast, super slim, beautiful user experience, instant reaction to touch.Where as this new oneplus 10 pro 5g 12gb RAM 256 capacity = is not even as good as oneplus 5t which came 5 years ago.Pros of oneplus 10 pro:- charges fast.- Camera in day is goodCons:- drains the battery as fast as it charges.- gets heated even when no application is in use.- touch screen not as reactive as it was in 5t.- more fatter than its predecessor.- battery drains even more faster if playing some game. I mean unbelievably fast draining of batter.- Camera at night = still useless, Iphone is far better.If you don't mind wasting your 72,000 INR on a shitty phone.Be my guest."
31,The phone is 10 days old and it has started heating up on normal use. There are a lot of software glitches and phone randomly crashes and takes 10 mins to restart. Seems like a hurried update.The battery charging is super fast; However it discharges even faster.Please opt for another phone and not this one.
32,"Well, I am very disappointed with Oneplus. It has everything one plus said, But just to think I pay 70K and there is no call recording!!Please buy this at your own risk. You may pay high price but not get Basic things."
33,"This is a review for phone users, not gamers, photographers, whole-day social media people. My usage of phone is for calling, some texting, and occasional videos and photographs. My last phone lasted for more than 5 years and is still working. This is my first OnePlus phone, so I don't know about their previous phone quality.Look and feel:Feels solid in the hand, grip is good with the supplied cover.Battery life:I have been using it for over a week and for me a single charge lasts for more than a day. In fact, recently I did a drive from South India to North India of over 2000kms and the phone was connected over Android Auto for more than 10 hrs each day. The battery lasted well.Heating?I didn't find any major heating issues. Some mild heat, yes. Its similar to if you keep running any machine non-stop, or even if you keep running, your body heats up. Its normal. I am not sure what everyone's expectation is with respect to phone's not heating up. Use it reasonably, it performs very well. Well, if you are always on phone, then probably it would heat up.  I don't even use 120hz refresh rate. To a normal human eye, the difference between 60-90-120hz is not perceptible. I keep it at 60, battery lasts long, doesn't heat. Phone is happy, I am happy :)Camera:Decent to nice photographs. Low ligt photography is also pretty good. For serious photography, I have a DSLR and other camera and I trust them more than any phone camera. For occasional clicks, this done a fine job.Gaming:I am not a gamer and have never played any game on any phone so don't have an opinion.Speed/StorageUltra fast with respect to installing, uninstalling apps. 256GB storage is more than sufficient for my use. My previous phone had 64GB and in 5 years, it never got full. Well, I keep a tight control on what gets installed and downloaded on my phone. I don't let junk accumulate on phone, keeps the phone and battery life long.Sound:Very good sound quality of speakers. Well its a phone and it can do only as much. For more serious viewing, I watch on my TV and home theater.Overall:A fantastic phone at this price point. I couldn't find anything that is bad with the phone. With my usage, it will easily last for more than 4-5 years."
34,                                    Â Pathetic phone
35,"Update after 5 days :tip for those howare planning to buy  if you keep refresh rate to 60hz and use battery saver phone gives battery back of 2 upto 2days.Had been using OnePlus 5  for 5 years thought an upgrade to 10 pro will be amazing but it's total let downPros over OnePlus 5 only front camera is an update and screen which is good but due to poor battery it's not usable so I would not term it as an upgrade really.Being a photographer and mobile photography enthusiast I have compared the back camera with s20Fe which now comes at 36k.I have to say s20fe back cam is real good than op10 pro . And I should have buyed s22 ultra staight away. I did not expect op10 to be as good as s22 ultra but it's even not worth for what it is priced at.So guys this phone is mere compromise in your life and nothing else. You think you will get everything but you don't get any of it trust me.If you really want a beast phone and don't have money to buy s22 ultra or an iPhone please take emi and buy , you won't ever regret I think"
36,"                                    Â Good and performance is excellent, also no heating issues ,only normal heat that all phones had .But little bit upset there is No IP68 ðŸ˜Œ"
37,"This is my 4th one plus device, using it since 2017. So i have the right to give perfect and honest review, it's probably the best heating Device. 50 seconds of camera on is enough to generate the heat. Heat in the sense not normal heat it's at hot as micro own . Pizza can be made on this without any difficulty . I am not telling this as sarcasm . The heat level is in intolerable limits . Other wise the phone is as smooth as marble.battery is good charging lists long. Pictures are great . Gaming is out of the level . Videos are awesome . Hope OnePlus looks into this and realise how much fans are savvy about this brand . We are proud of it . Please don't let us down ."
38,Been travelling with One plus since one plus one days. Though they went down trajectory since 7T. This phone has proved they are still one of the best in the business.Good performanceDecent cameraGood Battery lifeSuper fast charging ( literally)The smart phone you can get for this money.
39,"Its been 8days after buying the flagship oneplus 10pro mobile and it is not getting ON, so what needs to be written,I need this to be replaced with the new one"
